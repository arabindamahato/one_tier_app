# one_tier_application

- One Tire App means there is only one layer where all the operations are going to happen only that particular layer itself. 
That layer if only front-end layer no backend layer. 
	- If the application is very small or tiny then we look at the data which is present in that and if the data is also not getting modified very frequently , in such case we go for one-tire application.  
	- In one-tire architecture the chances of getting dyanmic data will be very less. Even if we get dynamic data the application will not be in a situation to handle it. HTML and CSS will not have the capacity to handle the dynamic data.
	- Dynamic website are the web sites where the data are changed on the basis of requirement.
	- Static Websites are the website or web application  where most of the data are fixed.
